# Sort-Algorithms-With-Design-Patterns

## Problem definition:
We have integer values that you can keep in the data structure you want. You can think that the maximum number of data for the exam is 100, and you can set this data by generating a random number. We want to sort this data using three different algorithms, so we want to have the chance to choose the algorithm at runtime. These three algorithms are "BubbleSort", "QuickSort (recursive)" and "InsertionSort". Perform this application using the design patterns. Write this application using the design patterns. In the design pattern you will use, show the implementation of all three algorithms for experimental purposes and also measure the runtime for each sorting algorithm.
